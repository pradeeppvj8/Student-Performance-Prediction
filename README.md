# Project Name
Students Performance Prediction

#### Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict student's performance based on attributes like gender, race, parents education level etc.

### Methods Used
* Linear Regression
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter


## Project Description
* The purpose of this project is to predict student's performance based on attributes like gender, race, parents education level , lunch type, status of test preparation course, reading and writing scores.
* The data has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977
* As part of EDA we have tried to figure out which variables are true indicators of students performance.
* After trying various learning algorithms, Linear Regression has been used to perform students performance prediction in this project.
